# subset-sum-algorithms

This repository contains implementations of 3 algorithms solving the decision subset sum problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) for my Bachelor's thesis called "FPT-algorithms for the Coin Problem and Knapsack Problem"

The implemented algorithms are:
- Dynamic algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem#Pseudo-polynomial_time_dynamic_programming_solutions)
- Koiliaris & Xu's algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1145/3329863)
- Bringmann's algorithm (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1610.04712)
